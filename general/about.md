# Autonomic Computing

<a href="https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/book/978-1-4471-5006-0"><img src = "img/book.jpg" style = "float : left; width : 150px; margin : 0 1em 0 1em;"/></a>

This web site comes with the book <a href="https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/book/978-1-4471-5006-0">"Autonomic Computing: Principles, Design and Implementation”</a> authored by Philippe Lalanda, Julie McCann and Ada Diaconescu. 

<a href="http://membres-liglab.imag.fr/lalanda/">Pr. Philippe Lalanda</a> is a professor of software engineering at the Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France.

<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jamm/">Dr. Julie A. McCann</a> is a Reader in Computer Systems at Imperial College London, UK.

<a href="http://adadiaconescu.there-you-are.com/">Dr. Ada Diaconescu </a> is a lecturer (Maître de conférences) in the Department of Computing and Networks at Télécom ParisTech, France.

The purpose of this site is to offer a Java-based learning environment in the domains of pervasive and autonomic computing. We believe that the pervasive domain is very illustrative and easy to grasp for students in computer science. Also, it characterizes requirements, such as device volatility, mobility, environmental change, etc., that often motivate self-management.

We hope this web environment will grow with the book, learning from the feedback that we receive from practitioners and students alike.
