# Purpose

This web site comes with the book “Autonomic Computing” authored by Philippe Lalanda, Julie McCann and Ada Diaconescu. The book is available, for instance, on Amazon.

The purpose os this site is to offer a Java-based learning environment in the domains of pervasive and autonomic computing. We believe that the pervasive domain is very illustrative and easy to grasp for students in computer science. Also, it characterizes requirements, such as device volatility, mobility, environmental change, etc., that often motivate self-management.

We hope this web environment will grow with the book, learning from the feedback that we receive from practitioners and students alike
