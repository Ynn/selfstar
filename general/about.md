This web site comes with the book <a href="https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/book/978-1-4471-5006-0">"Autonomic Computing: Principles, Design and Implementation”</a> authored by Philippe Lalanda, Julie McCann and Ada Diaconescu. 

<a href="http://membres-liglab.imag.fr/lalanda/">Pr. Philippe Lalanda</a> is a professor of software engineering at the Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France.

<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jamm/">Dr. Julie A. McCann</a> is a Reader in Computer Systems at Imperial College London, UK.

<a href="http://adadiaconescu.there-you-are.com/">Dr. Ada Diaconescu </a> is a lecturer (Maître de conférences) in the Department of Computing and Networks at Télécom ParisTech, France.

This book is aimed at students and practitioners working on software projects where system self-management would redress maintenance complexity and cost issues.

Authors have created this web site, which will be regularly updated, to allow students to execute autonomic code in a runtime simulation. The environment provides concrete, visual feedback of the behaviours illustrating what the student has programmed.
