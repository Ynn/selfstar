# Temperature management

In this first series of exercises, you will build a naive temperature system. Such system is often refered as an HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) system. An HVAC system manages the temperature, humidity, air flow and air quality of a given building. In this set of exercices we will solely focus on the temperature management.

The exercises have been designed to build upon each other: they should be followed in the given order.
We assume that you have completed the set of [follow me exercices](/article/exercises/follow-me) before starting this series.
 You can refer to the [getting started](article/for-beginners/getting-started) section and the [tutorial](article/for-beginners/basic-follow-m) if you need to.
