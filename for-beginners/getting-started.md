# Getting Started

The learning environment you have downloaded is made of three complementary tools (see figure):

+ **An Integrated Development Environment**. This Eclipse-based IDE provides comprehensive facilities for the development in OSGi/iPOJO. Specifically, it includes a source code editor, build automation tools and automated deployment on the execution platform.

+ **An Execution platform based on OSGi and iPOJO**. This platform supports the dynamic execution of the pervasive applications developed by students.

+ **A home simulator called iCASA**. This simulator is made of two synchronized parts: a GUI that can be run on any Web browser and a set of OSGi components running on the execution platform linked with the pervasive applications.

Developing applications requires a minimum understanding of OSGi and iPOJO. The following articles contain some basic points that students should consider : 

+ [Basics about OSGi](/article/for-beginners/intro-osgi): This article reminds you of OSGi fundamentals. Specifically, it discusses the notions of bundles and services, which are at the heart of the OSGi dynamism.

+ [Basics about Felix](/article/for-beginners/intro-felix): This article explains how the Apache Felix OSGi platform can be managed through a terminal or through a Web console.

+ [Basics about iPOJO](/article/for-beginners/intro-ipojo): This article presents the iPOJO component model and the associated lifecycle. It shows how to create and deploy components with the IDE and write a basic Hello world component. 

In the context of this site, we have developed an IDE facilitating the development and deployment of iPOJO applications. The following articles teach you how to use this IDE effectively : 

+ [Your first iPOJO component](/article/for-beginners/basic-hello-world): This article shows how to create and deploy a simple "Hello World" component with IDE. 

+ [iPOJO component instances](/article/for-beginners/component-properties): This article shows how to improve the "Hello World" component through the use of configuration properties, which allows to specialize the behaviour of component instances.

+ [Providing and using services](/article/for-beginners/intro-services): This article shows how to implement a multilingual "Hello world" using services.

+ [Dividing an application into multiple bundles](#): This article elaborates on the  "Hello World" and separates out the component providing services from those using services. It defines two bundles (client and consumer) and shows how to configure the dependencies between these bundles.

Finally, the following articles show how to configure and use the iCASA home simulator:
