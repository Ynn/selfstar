<p>We have designed a learning environment that allows students to progressively develop, execute, and test pervasive and autonomic applications. This environment comprises an IDE, an execution environment based on OSGi/iPOJO and a smart home simulator. The purpose of the simulator is to provide immediate, concrete feedback to the students developing their applications.</p>
 
<p>The pervasive domain is very illustrative and easy to grasp for students in computer science. Also, it is characterized by stringent requirements, like context-awareness or dynamicity, that motivate the introduction of self-management.</p>

					<p>Learning	OSGi	/	iPOJO	technologies may	take	some	time,	even for	good	JAVA	developers.	Students need	to	get	familiar	with	new	concepts	like	components	or	services but	they	also	have	to	learn	new	development	environments	(including	XML	configuration	files	and annotations).
					</p>
						<p>
In	order	to	allow	students	to	more	rapidly	focus	on	pervasive and autonomic	concepts,	we	have	developed	an	iPOJO	IDE	(Integrated	Development	Environment)	allowing	the	rapid	and	simplified	development	of	iPOJO	applications.	This	environment	provides	a	set	of	facilities	to	assist	the	developer	in the	creation	and	deployment	of	iPOJO	components.	In	particular,	a	number	of	classes	and	files	are	(partially)	generated.	Also,	deployment	can	be	fully	automated. </p>

					<p>Our execution platform is based on OSGi. More precisely, it is a customized version of a popular OSGi implementation called Felix with a set of specific artefacts automatically deployed.</p>
						<p>OSGi is an execution framework developed on top of Java. It builds on the Javaâ€™s dynamic features (classloaders and on demand class loading) to provide a coarse-grained level of modularity.</p>
						<p>OSGi supports the dynamic deployment of applications. In short, it means that you can easily install or update an application (or part of an application) at runtime without restarting the whole platform.</p>
